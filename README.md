# Trip Planner

## Overview
A trip planner inspired by Wanderlog where you can create trips and its itinerary, keep track of lodging, budget, and collaborate with friends on trip details. I wanted to create a trip planner because I've always done this scrappily through Google Sheets or Docs (sorry Wanderlog, I know you're right there), and was thinking it'd be pretty cool to create one for myself, and share with friends and family! We can all collaborate and make it better!

The MVP for this planner will focus on creating trips only. After that, I hope to incorporate budget tracking and viewing past trips on a map / log.
